Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or if you want to discuss with me
(my email address is at the botton of this page). I'll probably release the
sources for the poster in the future (both Latex, snakemake workflow, and python scripts),
so it will be 100% reproducible within few easy steps. I'm happy to share it
in a draft version if you want to collaborate with me.
