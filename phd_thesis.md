I am very happy and proud to present my PhD thesis to you.

**From alpha to beta ocean: Exploring the role of surface buoyancy fluxes and seawater thermal expansion in setting the upper ocean stratification**



The thesis is a compilation of articles, which is made of the so-called "kappa"
(a Swedish word concept that more or less means summary) and the appended articles.
The articles can be found at the following links:

* **Paper I**: Caneill, R., Roquet, F., Madec, G., & Nycander, J. (2022).
The Polar Transition from Alpha to Beta Regions Set by a Surface Buoyancy Flux Inversion.
*Journal of Physical Oceanography, 52* (8), 1887â€“1902.

* **Paper II**: Caneill, R., Roquet, F., & Nycander, J. (2023).
Southern Ocean deep mixing band emerges from competition between winter buoyancy loss and stratification.
