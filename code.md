# [gsw-xarray](/gsw-xarray)

[gsw-xarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://gsw-xarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I am one of the 2 core developers of gsw-xarray.
This is a wrapper around gsw that add the correct cf attributes (standard_name, units)
when used with xarray datasets. If you use pint-xarray, it will also check the input
units and convert them if necessary.

# xgcm

[xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I participated to xgcm by writing some parts of the documentation
([boundary conditions](https://xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boundary_conditions.html),
[NEMO example](https://xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xgcm-examples/04_nemo_idealized.html)),
correct some minors typos, and participated to discussion about vertical remapping.
